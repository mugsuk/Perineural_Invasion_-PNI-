### Introduction


- PNI describes a microscopic finding of tumour infiltration along a nerve, and is distinguished from...
- Perineural Spread (PNS), which describes the presence of gross tumour growth along a nerve distinct from the main tumour mass on imaging.

- PNI is defined as cancer cell invasion in, around, and through nerves where tumour cells are seen within any of the layers (epineurium, perineurium, endoneurium) of the nerve sheath.
  - when tumour cells are not seen in the layers of nerve sheath, it can be difficult to differentiate it from tumour abutting on nerve
- not a common finding as neural tissue tends to be fairly resistant to tumour invasion
  - 2.5 -- 5% of H&N tumours[^2]
- if present is a poor prognosticator as there may well be invisible perineural spread of malignancy well beyond the surgical resection margins

- always look for this on CT & MRI for pxs with advanced SCC
- on CT:
  - nerve thickening or widening of foramina (esp. if there is loss of cortex around the foramen)
  - loss of fat in specific areas (e.g. PPF)
- on MRI (preferred modality)
  - thickening
  - increased enhancement
  - best visualised with fat suppression

### Critical nerves involved:

- auriculotemporal nerve (of Vc) for parotid tumours
- inferior alveolar nerve (and eventually mental and incisive nerves) of Vc for inferior alveolar involving tumours, or the skin over the chin and lip
- maxillary division of trigem, for nasal (and greater palatine)

Adenoid cystic CA has particular predisposition to PNI

Clinical correlation is essential -- cranial nerve assessment!!
